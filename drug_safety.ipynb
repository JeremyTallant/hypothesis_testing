To promote transparency and reproducibility of the drug's outcome, they (GlobalXYZ) have presented the dataset to your organization, a non-profit that focuses primarily on drug safety.\n","\n","The dataset provided contained five adverse effects, demographic data, vital signs, etc. Your organization is primarily interested in the drug's adverse reactions. It wants to know if the adverse reactions, if any, are of significant proportions. It has asked you to explore and answer some questions from the data.\n","\n","The dataset `drug_safety.csv` was obtained from [Hbiostat](https://hbiostat.org/data/) courtesy of the Vanderbilt University Department of Biostatistics. It contained five adverse effects: headache, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, upper respiratory infection, chronic obstructive airway disease (COAD), demographic data, vital signs, lab measures, etc. The ratio of drug observations to placebo observations is 2 to 1.\n","\n","For this project, the dataset has been modified to reflect the presence and absence of adverse effects `adverse_effects` and the number of adverse effects in a single individual `num_effects`.\n","\n","The columns in the modified dataset are: \n","\n","| Column | Description |\n","|--------|-------------|\n","|`sex` | The gender of the individual |\n","|`age` | The age of the individual |\n","|`week` | The week of the drug testing |\n","|`trx` | The treatment (Drug) and control (Placebo) groups | \n","|`wbc` | The count of white blood cells |\n","|`rbc` | The count of red blood cells |\n","|`adverse_effects` | The presence of at least a single adverse effect |\n","|`num_effects` | The number of adverse effects experienced by a single individual |\n","\n","The original dataset can be found [here](https://hbiostat.org/data/repo/safety.rda)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"62dc2a93-8a9c-4757-8aac-214c5de63e74","metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>age</th>\n","      <th>sex</th>\n","      <th>trx</th>\n","      <th>week</th>\n","      <th>wbc</th>\n","      <th>rbc</th>\n","      <th>adverse_effects</th>\n","      <th>num_effects</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>62</td>\n","      <td>male</td>\n","      <td>Drug</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>7.3</td>\n","      <td>5.1</td>\n","      <td>No</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>62</td>\n","      <td>male</td>\n","      <td>Drug</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>No</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>62</td>\n","      <td>male</td>\n","      <td>Drug</td>\n","      <td>12</td>\n","      <td>5.6</td>\n","      <td>5.0</td>\n","      <td>No</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>62</td>\n","      <td>male</td>\n","      <td>Drug</td>\n","      <td>16</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>No</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>62</td>\n","      <td>male</td>\n","      <td>Drug</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>6.6</td>\n","      <td>5.1</td>\n","      <td>No</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["   age   sex   trx  week  wbc  rbc adverse_effects  num_effects\n","0   62  male  Drug     0  7.3  5.1              No            0\n","1   62  male  Drug     1  NaN  NaN              No            0\n","2   62  male  Drug    12  5.6  5.0              No            0\n","3   62  male  Drug    16  NaN  NaN              No            0\n","4   62  male  Drug     2  6.6  5.1              No            0"]},"execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# Import packages\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","from scipy.stats import norm\n","from statsmodels.stats.proportion import proportions_ztest\n","import pingouin\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","# Load the dataset\n","drug_safety = pd.read_csv(\"data/drug_safety.csv\")\n","\n","# Preview df\n","drug_safety.head()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"e31db52b","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.16"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
